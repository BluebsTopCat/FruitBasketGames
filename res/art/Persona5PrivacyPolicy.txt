This app / It refers to Persona 5 Widget.

I'm going to pre-empt this privacy policy with the fact that incredibly dense, hard-to-read swaths of text are stupid, so here's the bullet points of everything you need to know:


1: This app does request your location in the background, even when not using the app directly. This is to fetch weather data to keep the app up to date.

2: This location data is not stored anywhere, nor is it collected by anyone. It is, however, sent off anonymously to https://wttr.in for the weather data.

3: No other data / personal information is ever requested when using this app.

4: This app is given at your own risk. I'm not responsible for any issues you may have with it, nor am I obligated to keep it updated or functional.
